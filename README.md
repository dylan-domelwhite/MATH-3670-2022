# MATH 3670 - Programming Examples

This repository contains programming examples that will be referenced on homework assignments. You can open the files here on GitHub to see the output. In order to edit or run the code again you will need to open this repository in Binder or download the files and install the required dependencies to run them (see below).

Click the following button to open this repository in an interactive online environment for running/tweaking the python code examples: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dylan-domelwhite/MATH-3670-2022/main). Once the environment has launched, navigate to the various code examples using the file browser on the left-hand side. If you want to download the code to run on your own computer, you will need to install the latest version of python, the packages listed in *requirements.txt*, and jupyter-lab to view the .ipynb files.
