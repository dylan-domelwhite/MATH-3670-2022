# MATH 3670 - Programming Examples

This repository contains programming examples that will be referenced on homework assignments. You can open the files here on GitHub to see the output. In order to edit or run the code again you will need to open this repository in Binder or download the files and install the required dependencies to run them (see below).

Click this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dylan-domelwhite/MATH-3670-2022/main) to open this repository in an interactive online environment for running/tweaking the python code examples. Once the environment has launched, navigate to the various code examples using the file browser on the left-hand side. If you want to download the code to run on your own computer, you will need to install the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the packages listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), and [jupyter-lab](https://jupyter.org/install) to view the .ipynb files.

There are also MATLAB files provided if you prefer that to python. If you haven't used MATLAB before, I recommend using [MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html). To run the MATLAB code examples, create a new script file and copy and paste the code in. You may need to create an account using your student email address. There is also a [desktop client](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) that you can download to run offline.
